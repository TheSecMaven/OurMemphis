# OurMemphis
A Project to shed light on previously difficult to understand and view crime data. The people of Memphis deserve to know what is going on in their own backyards. This tool is intended to provide a simple way to do just that, with the goal of finding ways to fix it. 

# Crime Data
All crime data used is authentic and has been pulled from https://mdsas.memphispolice.org/cw/n/cyberwatch.php 

# Apartment Complex Data
All apartment names and locations are authentic and have been pulled using the Google Places API: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro
# Uses
## The Betterment of Apartment Complexes
This tool could be used for a number of things. But let's focus on apartment complexes first. These complexes often provide shelter to the young professionals of Memphis, the future of Memphis in many cases. Yet there are countless complexes that continue to provide breeding grounds for Crime, as this tool will show. This is unacceptable and should be unacceptable to the tenants of said complexes. 

If Memphians come together and ask for a solution, solutions will be provided. Nobody wants to live in a crime ridden area fearing their safety. 
## Predicting High Crime Areas in the Future
Using data such as vacant or for sale homes we can make predictions on crime rates in the surrounding area based off of historical data. While this is a little far off, this is a huge advantage when it comes to fighting the threats.

## The Betterment of Public Parks and Areas
This tool could be used to predict spikes in crime near a public park. This could be used to send out alerts notifying others to keep an eye out in that area or to simply alert the Police Department that this area is at higher risk than usual. 

# Future
We live in a great city. With this tool, I hope the people of Memphis can have a better understanding of what is happening in our city. Not only this, but I hope we can find ways to solve these problems that we face so that the future of Memphis is nothing but bright.
