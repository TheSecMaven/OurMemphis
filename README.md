# OurMemphis
A Project to shed light on previously difficult to understand and view crime data. The people of Memphis deserve to know what is going on in their own backyards. This tool is intended to provide a simple way to do just that, with the goal of finding ways to fix it. 

# Uses
## The Betterment of Apartment Complexes
This tool could be used for a number of things. But let's focus on apartment complexes first. These complexes often provide shelter to the young professionals of Memphis, the future of Memphis in many cases. Yet there are countless complexes that continue to provide breeding grounds for Crime, as this tool will show. This is unacceptable and should be unacceptable to the tenants of said complexes. 

If Memphians come together and ask for a solution, solutions will be provided. Nobody wants to live in a crime ridden area fearing their safety. 

# Future
We live in a great city. With this tool, I hope the people of Memphis can have a better understanding of what is happening in our city. Not only this, but I hope we can find ways to solve these problems that we face so that the future of Memphis is nothing but bright.
